        <p>
          I've always been into sport but lacked confidence. I was 9 stone 6
          playing football 5 times a week with no structure to life at all.
          That’s when I started training and it's safe to say I’ve never looked
          back.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I immediately fell in love with constantly challenging myself. I
          wanted to be better every day - getting into good habits, routines and
          actually making a change in my life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There’s more to it than just lifting weights, losing fat and looking
          good. It fires up a mentality in you that you’ll never have thought
          you had.

          My experience and education from young has been science based having
